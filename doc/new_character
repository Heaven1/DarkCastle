Dark Castle supports two ways picking your beginning $BATTRIBUTES$R such as
$BSTR$R ($BSTRENGTH$R), $BDEX$R ($BDEXTERITY$R), $BCON$R ($BCONSTITUION$R),
$BINT$R ($BINTELLIGENCE$R) or $BWIS$R ($BWISDOM$R). The first method is
rolling virtual dice. The virtual dice consisting of either three 6-sided
dice or six 3-sided dice. The game picks the larger group of those two
separate sets of dice rolls and throws out any sets with a sum less than 12.
You can roll virtual dice as many times as you like. The second method is you
get 12 points in each attribute and 21 points you can divide among those five
attributes. Using this method gives you a total of 81 attribute points.
